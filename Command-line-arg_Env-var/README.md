# Command line arguments in python: 

Command-line arguments in Python are the inputs provided to a Python script when it's executed in the command line or terminal. When you run a Python script from the command line, you can pass additional information or parameters to the script.

### Python provides access to these command-line arguments through the `sys.argv` list in the `sys` module. Here's a breakdown of `sys.argv` :

--> `sys.argv[0]` contains the name of the Python script being executed.
--> `sys.argv[1]` `sys.argv[2]`, and so on contain the additional command-line arguments provided when running the script.

## See the code in this repo to understand in better way.
