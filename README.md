# Functions-Modules-Packages

## 1. In this repo we'll be discussing about difference between Functions, Modules and Package.And why it's important

### Functions.  

A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can take inputs, called arguments. They are a way to encapsulate and reuse code.

## Modules.

A module is a Python script containing Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables that can be used in other Python scripts. Modules help organize and modularize your code, making it more maintainable.
You can use this module in another script

## Packages

A package is a collection of modules organized in directories. Packages help you organize related modules into a hierarchy. They contain a special file named `__init__.py`, which indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.

**Example:**

Suppose you have a package sturcture as follows:

```
my_package/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
```

You can use modules from this package as follows:

```
from my_package import module1

result = module1.function_from_module1()
```

In this example , `my_package` is a Python package containing modules `module1` and `modules`

## 3. Python Workspaces.

Python workspaces refer to the environment in which you develop and run your Python code. They include the Python interpreter, installed libraries, and the current working directory. Understanding workspaces is essential for managing dependencies and code organization.

Python workspaces can be local or virtual environments. A local environment is the system-wide Python installation, while a virtual environment is an isolated environment for a specific project. You can create virtual environments using tools like `virtualenv` or `venv`.

**Example**

```
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS/Linux)
source myenv/bin/activate
```
